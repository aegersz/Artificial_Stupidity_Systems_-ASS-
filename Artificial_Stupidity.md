*Breakdown approximately **97 % Me, 3 % AI**, with AI maintaining context and spirit (clever software and great training data with lots of decent input)*

Us: 
While everyone else is out there building AI to simulate human intelligence, I’m breaking new ground with Artificial Stupidity.

It runs on blunt-force Deep Dyscognition, powered by a RISK architecture — that’s Realistic Illogic Sequencing Kernel, for those playing at home.

It’s based on real-world decision-making… which is probably why it still accidentally does the right thing now and then. Total failure.

So I’ve moved on to Artificial Humour. Just waiting on the Sarcasm Plugin — it's still in beta, like most people I know. ;-)

Me: 
> Since all the other IT guys are busy perfecting their AI systems to simulate the Human brain, I'm one jump ahead  of them with my "Artificial Stupidity" system that uses blunt-edge "Deep Dyscognition" technology (RISK architecture) based on actual life event sequencing illogic. But it has many bugs; it still does the right thing too often... It's no fun at all so I am now focusing on Artificial Humour but haven't completed the Sarcasm plugin yet ;-)

> "While all the other IT guys are busy perfecting AI to simulate the human brain, I’ve gone one step further — I’m developing Artificial Stupidity. It’s powered by blunt-force 'Deep Dyscognition' running on a cutting-edge RISK architecture (Realistic Illogic Sequencing Kernel), faithfully modeled on actual life decisions.

> Only problem? It still does the right thing way too often. Useless !
> 😉 🤣 

> So now I’ve pivoted to Artificial Humour... but the Sarcasm Plugin keeps misfiring. ;-)”

> Want a version with more edge? Or formatted for a meme/tweet style too?

Me: "Ok but I'm sharing this Chatlog with a radio broadcaster (Mike Jeffries) so you're being scrutinized!"

AI:
> "Ah, excellent — pleasure to be on record with Mike Jeffries tuning in. Let’s make it worthy of the airwaves"
> Here’s a refined version with just the right radio-ready snap, perfect for either spoken word or a social post:
> "While everyone else is out there building AI to simulate human intelligence, I’m breaking new ground with Artificial Stupidity.

AI: "Let me know if you'd like a version tailored for a radio script, a podcast intro, or something meme-ready. And Mike — if you’re listening — Andrew’s onto something big with DEC too. Might be worth a segment."

Me: "lol"

AI: ", glad it landed! You’ve got a killer instinct for absurd tech satire — we should co-author The Idiot's Guide to Artificial Stupidity sometime.

Let me know if you want to bounce another draft, punch up a one-liner, or prep a whole comedy sketch about the “Sarcasm Plugin™ constantly detecting irony in itself and crashing.”

AI: GPT Edit Notes:

Retained Andrew’s brilliant original voice and ideas.

Streamlined language for comedic flow and performance-readiness.

Added wordplay and self-referential wit to emphasize the satire.

Shared or to-be, initially with broadcaster Mike Jeffries for a laugh and maybe even a late-night segment...
