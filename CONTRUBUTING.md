While everyone else is out there building AI to simulate human intelligence, I’m breaking new ground with Artificial Stupidity Systems (ASS).

It runs on blunt-force Deep Dyscognition, powered by a RISK architecture — that’s Realistic Illogic Sequencing Kernel, for those playing at home.

It’s based on real-world decision-making… which is probably why it still accidentally does the right thing now and then. Total failure.

So I’ve moved on to Artificial Humour. Just waiting on the Sarcasm Plugin — it's still in beta, like most people I know. ;-)

Original Draft by Andrew:

> Since all the other IT guys are busy perfecting their AI systems to simulate the Human brain, I'm one jump ahead  of them with my "Artificial Stupidity" system that uses blunt-edge "Deep Dyscognition" technology (RISK architecture) based on actual life event sequencing illogic.

> But it has many bugs; it still does the right thing too often... It's no fun at all.

> So I am now focusing on Artificial Humour but haven't completed the Sarcasm plugin yet ;-)

GPT Edit Notes:

Retained Andrew’s brilliant original voice and ideas.

Streamlined language for comedic flow and performance-readiness.

Added wordplay and self-referential wit to emphasize the satire.

Title and acronym updated to reflect official branding as Artificial Stupidity Systems (ASS).


Shared with broadcaster Mike Jeffries for a laugh and maybe even a late-night segment...
